- Only first motion should send notification
- Subsequent motions should be logged but not notified until interval passes

### Phase 4: Advanced Feature Tests

#### 4.1 Multiple Chat Test (if configured)
- Motion should trigger notifications to all enabled chats
- Status updates should go to designated chats only

#### 4.3 Quiet Hours Test (if enabled)
- Set quiet hours in configuration
- Motion during quiet hours should be logged but not notified

#### 4.4 Daily Counter Reset Test
- Check notification counter resets at midnight
- Verify statistics tracking

### Phase 5: Error Handling Tests

#### 5.1 WiFi Disconnection Test
- Disconnect WiFi (turn off router/hotspot)
- Device should detect disconnection
- Device should attempt reconnection
- LED should blink slowly during disconnection

#### 5.2 Telegram API Failure Test
- Block internet access temporarily
- Motion should still be detected and logged
- Notifications should retry when connection restored

#### 5.3 Memory Stress Test

- Long connection delays
- Frequent disconnections

**Tests:**
```bash
# Check WiFi diagnostics
/info command in Telegram
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify 2.4GHz network (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Check signal strength and proximity to router
- Verify credentials in secrets.h
- Try different WiFi channel on router

#### Telegram Not Working
**Symptoms:**
- Bot doesn't respond to commands
- No startup notification received
- "Failed to send notification" errors

**Tests:**
```bash
# Manual bot test in browser:
https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getMe
https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/sendMessage?chat_id=<ID>&text=test
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify bot token format and validity
- Check chat ID (negative for groups/channels)
- Ensure bot added to channel as admin
- Test with personal chat first

#### Motion Detection Issues
**Symptoms:**
- No motion detected
- False positive detections
- Inconsistent sensitivity

**Tests:**
- Check PIR sensor LED indicator (if available)
- Test with different motion patterns
- Monitor raw sensor readings in debug mode

**Solutions:**
- Verify wiring connections (VCC, GND, OUT)
- Check GPIO pin configuration
- Adjust PIR sensitivity potentiometer
- Allow full stabilization time (30+ seconds)

#### Memory Issues
**Symptoms:**
- Device crashes or restarts
- "Low memory warning" messages
- Degraded performance over time

**Tests:**
- Monitor `/status` memory readings
- Check for memory leaks in long-term operation

**Solutions:**
- Reduce debug level
- Optimize message templates
- Increase minimum memory threshold

## üìà Performance Benchmarks
